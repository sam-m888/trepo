# Steps
A list of actions (steps) to take during a traversal, each modifying the traversal in some way.

Each step should advance the traversal according to its definition. If a step "branches", it should return a list of new traversals.

**JSON Example:**

````javascript
{
  "name": "node",
  "params": {
    "id": "467251c3-a5d9-4ae1-8268-0c2b5eaf19d6"
  }
}
